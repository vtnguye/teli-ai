Hello?
Hello, are you the homeowner of 216 Elm Street Pontiac?
Yes.
Okay, by any chance are you interested in selling the property for cash?
Why are you asking that?
Well, if you're interested. If not, then no worries.
Hold on, hold on a second. I can't hear you there.
What kind of offer are you giving?
Well, I can't give you a dead offer, but I can give you a range.
Okay, what's a range?
It could be, so depending on how much renovation the house needs, it could be between $15,000 and all the way up to $58,000. That's the range.
Okay.
So obviously you're going to...
So my dread is now, you call back tomorrow about 3 o'clock?
Okay, I could do that for you, yeah. It will be from some other guy's number. It's going to be my partner's number if that's okay with you.
Okay. Is this house on the list? Is this house on the foreclosure list or something?
Oh, no, no. We're just looking to buy properties and fix them up and sell them for profit. That's the only reason why we're doing this.
Okay. And he's old too, so he needs to flat. He needs to be on something, one level.
Okay, I understand.
So do you have like, is there any issues they can tell me about the house, like when it comes to like problems and stuff like that?
Well, I don't know. I'm just a caretaker for him.
Caretaker? Okay.
Uh-huh. And he won't be back until tomorrow.
But you wouldn't know if he's interested or do you know if he is interested in something?
I know that he is. I believe that he is interested. That's why I said call back tomorrow at 3.
Okay, I appreciate your time. And just let him know or if you're there as well, just know there will be a different number calling you.
And it's going to be my partner.

And you work out the details and all that stuff.
Okay, thank you. What's your name?
Ivan.
Okay, Ivan.
Nice to meet you. What about you?
Bye-bye. Ms. White.
Ms. White? All right, thank you very much. You have a good one.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
