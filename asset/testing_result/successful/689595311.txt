Hello?
Hello. Hi, are you the property owner on East Harry Avenue?
I am.
I go and check your property about a week ago and I was wondering if you could finish an order for cash. They can get offers.
Well can you tell me a little bit more about the property and what you have under it?
It's a five bedroom, two baths. The kitchen and the main bathroom both need remodeling. We have a three car garage, full basements, two lots. I just put a new flooring in there. I have carpet that's a little, that's a few years old. Yeah, that's about it.
Okay and the kitchen?
Needs updating badly.
Okay. That's okay. How about the bathroom?
The bathrooms? They need work.
They need work as well? Okay. And the bedrooms are fine?
Yeah.
My range is around 160 to 210. That sound about good to you?
Yeah.
We do all cash offers too.
Okay.
What's the ballpark in mind for you though? What's in your mind?
Right where I want it to be.
That's where you want it to be?
Yep.
Okay. Yeah. I plan on putting it on the market this week. Probably by the end of the week. I'm going to be there on Wednesday if you want to walk through it.
Yeah, that would be fun with me.
What time for you?
Say two o'clock.
Two o'clock?
Yeah.
One or two.
Either one.
Okay.
I want to make sure the numbers are right before I come walk the property. You know what I mean?
Yep, I understand.
Yeah. I mean, it seems like we're on the same page on this.
Perfect, yeah.
No, we want to...
Sorry, what were you saying?
I mean, it seems like your friend's kind of listed for you, you know.
Well, I have a realtor right now, but it's a friend of mine. I do plan on putting the house up on sale probably by the end of the week. You can take a look through it. If the offer is where I need it to be or where I want it to be, we'll talk. If it's lower than that, then I won't. I'm not going to close balls. I'm just going to put it in the description for 90 grand or something. That's not evidence.
Okay.
I know you guys look through taxes and stuff and you think I don't have my taxes paid, but if you look again, you'll notice that they're paid up in full. So I'm not worried about that at all.
Yeah, that's great that everything's paid off.
Yeah, you know, it doesn't work to it, you know.
Yeah.
I'll be there Wednesday. How many times? Between 12 and 2, I'll be there.
Okay, perfect.
I don't have much left. I just got to paint some ceilings.
But it seems like your friend's kind of listed for you, you know.
Yeah, you know, it doesn't work to it, you know. It works to it, exactly.
Okay. I mean, it seems like we're on the same page on this.
Perfect, yeah.
Okay, and I can give you a call around like 10.
Sure.
Okay, perfect. Works. Perfect.
Okay, what was your name?
Todd Raven.
Todd Raven? Okay, Todd.
 Your name was? 
 Emilio. 
All right, nice to meet you, Emilio.
Nice to meet you too. Thank you for your time. 
Thank you. 
Bye-bye. 
Bye.
