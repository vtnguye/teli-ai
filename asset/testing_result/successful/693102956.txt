Hello, are you the homeowner of 26 West Yale Avenue in Pontiac?
Yeah, I think I am. Why?
Well, I came across your property and was wondering if you were interested in selling it for cash.
Oh, shit. All depends, man. The right price is always the right price.
Well, what's the price that you have in mind for the property?
I was thinking probably like at least around 130, 140.
Okay, 130, 140. And could you tell me any like renovations that have been done to the property?
Well, they've done to the property. I just basically put new flooring in and just regular maintaining work, you know what I'm saying?
Like the paint mess about it. I didn't do no extra whatever, nothing to the house.
All right. And was there like any like are there any problems with the house when it comes to like let's say piping, stuff like that, heating?
No, no, everything worked.
All right.
So you're saying 130 to 140. So the range I can give you on the house, it's going to be between $119,000 and $163,000. That's the range.
And obviously it could either be lower or higher depending on your renovations and how much work the house actually needs.
Yeah.
So with your estimate and your value you want, you are at least in the ballpark of where we want it to be.
And I can give you give your number to one of my partners and I can have them call you either later today or even tomorrow if you're free.
And you guys can get into more detail about the property.
And what time?
I'm sorry, what?
I'm sorry, what?
Best time to get tomorrow.
Best time tomorrow? What time, what time would you like to call?
Around the same time.
All right.
And so if you were to go with this deal, you're going to be saving on real estate fees as well as property fees, as well as all the hassle when it comes to putting the house on the market when you have people going in and out of your house.
Since we're doing it all cash based it'll be quick and easy.
All right.
So that sounds good.
At two o'clock tomorrow around two o'clock I'll let my partner know to give you a call.
All right.
Yeah.
It's not a for sure thing.
It's just you know what I'm saying.
Yeah.
If everything works out.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?
You never know.
Yeah.
I understand.
All right.
It'll be from a different phone number.
So if you see a different phone number call you.
Most likely answer will be him.
Where you guys are out of?
I'm in Novi and my partner is also in Novi.
All right.
What you guys want to do with the trade or?
It's his company mainly.
I'm just helping him along with it.
Essentially we buy properties and we do renovations to them and then we flip it.
So if the property needs a lot of work and you're let's say if the property valuation is like $80,000 but the person wants $100,000 for it.
We're not going to be able to do it because we're trying to make money on the same end of it.
We're trying to benefit everyone.
That's a terrible.
Yeah.
All right.
No problem.
All right.
I appreciate your time and hope to have your answer tomorrow.
All right.
Thanks.
Bye bye.
