Hello?
Yes?
Hi mister, are you the property owner on 105 Wendellwood Drive in Pontiac?
No, that's my ex-husband, why?
Okay, I'm just calling to see if he might be interested in selling the property for a cash offer on the home.
I can tell you right now, absolutely not.
No. That is a house he will die in.
Okay, are there any properties that you might own or family or friends that might be looking to sell their property in the future?
No.
Okay then, you have a good day.
And can you please have your room moved?
Just come to call us.
Yes ma'am, take care.
Thank you.
