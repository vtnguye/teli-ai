Hello? 
Hi, I'm looking for Christopher Raleigh. 
He's not here. 
Oh, he's not there at the moment. 
Okay, well, I'm just a local homebuyer in the area. 
Just calling to see if you might be interested in selling the property at Granada Drive. 
No, no, no. We're not selling any property. 
I wish you people would stop calling us and give us another call. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay, I'll put you on my do not call list. 
Just a little bit.
