Hello?
hello, are you the homeowner of 49649 Red Pine Drive in Maycomb?
Um, yes, what's up?
By any chance are you interested in selling the property for cash?
To sell it? 
Yeah, if you're interested.
How much are you willing to pay?
Well, do you have like an estimate in mind for the property?
Um... I think... I'm not really sure, I'd have to look it up.
Okay, so like the estimate that I have here from Zillow is between $391,000 all the way up to $432,000. That's the estimate.
okay
Okay. And could you confirm to me just to make sure that you're the actual homeowner how many bedrooms and bathrooms does the property have?
Um, it's got one on the main floor and I believe two or three upstairs
Okay, just wanted to make sure.
So if you were to sell the property, what price would you want to sell it at?
I don't know, I was probably somewhere in the middle, like $410,000 to $420,000.
Okay, and if you do not mind me asking, is the property fully remodeled or does it need renovations?
What was that, I'm sorry?
Like does the property need renovations done to it? are there any problems with like plumbing, cabinets, flooring?
No, not really, no problems from there.
Okay, that's awesome. So essentially it's pretty much up to date, correct?
Yes, sir.
Okay, well we are looking for properties that need renovations and stuff like that so this probably is not a good fit. If you don't mind me asking, do you have any other properties that need work that you are interested in selling for cash?
No I do not have any sorry
No Problem, have a great day 
Thanks
