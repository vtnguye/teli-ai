Hello?
Hi, are you the property owner on Brooklyn Drive in Troy?
What? Who is this?
My name is Emilio, I came across this property and I was wondering if you were interested in selling it for cash?
No, I am not...Well, how much do you think these properties are worth here?
Well, I can't give you a full cash offer without taking a look at the property in person, but I can give you a range from $275,000 to $300,000.
Oh, no, I can get more than that.
Alright, well thank you for your time
