Hello?
Hello.
Hi, are you the property owner on Grove Avenue in East Point?
Yes, sir.
Hi, I came across this property and I was trying to see if you were interested in selling it for cash.
Yeah, yeah, $150.
You want $150 for it?
Yes, sir.
Okay. Uh, is that the least you would go on it?
No, I can give them out bit by bit.
I'm talking about the price for $150 you want. Like, is that enough to negotiate more down?
No, sir. 
Oh, $150. It's brand new. It's a brand new remodel.
Oh, everything is brand new. 
Okay, I see. 
Okay, do you have any other property you're interested in selling?
Yes, yes.
Do you have...
Yes, I have a ton of them. Three of them I'm remodeling.
Yes, sir. 
Okay, okay. Do you have any properties that need work to it?
No, sir. 
No, everything is updated?
Yes, sir. That's what I do. I update them and I sell them.
Oh, I see.
Okay. Well, thank you so much for your time, sir.
Yes, sir.
Bye-bye.
