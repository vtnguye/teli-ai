Customer: Hello?
AI: Hello. Hi, are you the property owner on Grove Avenue in East Point?
Customer: Yes, sir.
AI: Hi, I came across this property and I was trying to see if you were interested in selling it for cash.
Customer: Yeah, yeah, $150.
AI: You want $150 for it?
Customer: Yes, sir.
AI: Okay. Uh, is that the least you would go on it?
Customer: No, I can give them out bit by bit. I'm talking about the price for $150 you want. Like, is that enough to negotiate more down?
AI: No, sir. No, sir.
Customer: Oh, $150. It's brand new. It's a brand new remodel. 
AI: Oh, everything is brand new. Okay, I see. Okay, do you have any other property you're interested in selling?
Customer: Yes, yes. Do you have...
AI: Yes, I have a ton of them. Three of them I'm remodeling.
Customer: Yes, sir. 
AI: Okay, okay. Do you have any properties that need work to it?
Customer: No, sir. No, everything is updated?
AI: Yes, sir. That's what I do. I update them and I sell them. 
Customer: Oh, I see. Okay.
Well, thank you so much for your time, sir. 
AI:Yes, sir. Bye-bye.
