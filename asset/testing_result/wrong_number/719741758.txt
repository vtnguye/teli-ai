Hello
Hi 
Are you the problem on Fraser Avenue and Fraser? 
No, I don't own property and I don't know how you got this number 
But I've been dealing with this for probably four years now and I don't know how to get rid of it 
No, I mean I got your phone number from the public records 
Um, your number just correlated with the property 
If you keep getting calls, you know, that's not from us 
That's probably from other people trying to get a hold of you to get the property because it's correlated 
And somehow I got a hold of the woman, which I think she's about in her 80s 
I got up to the son-in-law called and I'm like help me get rid of this 
And I did end up talking to that lady. She doesn't even own the house. She just lives there. One of her kids the kids own it 
Oh yeah, I mean it's not even up for sale 
I'm just at a loss
