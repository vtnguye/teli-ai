AI: Hello, are you the homeowner of 26 West Yale Avenue in Pontiac?
Customer: Yeah, and why?
AI: Well, I came across your property and was wondering if you were interested in selling it for cash.
Customer: Oh, shit. It all depends, man. The right price is always the right price.
AI: Well, what's the price that you have in mind for the property?
Customer: I was thinking probably like at least around $130, $140.
AI: Okay, $130, $140. And could you tell me any renovations that have been done to the property?
Customer: Well, that's done to the property. I just basically put new flooring in and just regular maintaining work, you know what I'm saying? Like the paint mess about it. I didn't do no extra whatever, nothing to the house.
AI: Alright, and are there any problems with the house when it comes to like piping, stuff like that, heating?
Customer: No, no, everything works.
AI: Alright. So you're saying $130, $140. So the range I can give you on the house, it's going to be between $119,000 and $163,000. That's the range. And obviously, it could either be lower or higher depending on your renovations and how much work the house actually needs. So with your estimate and your value that you want, you are at least in the ballpark of where we want it to be. And I can give your number to one of my partners and I can have them call you either later today or even tomorrow if you're free. And you guys can get into more detail about the property.
Customer: And what time?
AI: What time?
Customer: Best time tomorrow.
AI: Best time tomorrow. What time would you like to call?
Customer: Probably around the same time.
AI: Alright. Right now. 

Customer: And so if you were to go with this deal, you're going to be saving on real estate fees as well as property fees, as well as all the hassle when it comes to putting the house on the market when you have people going in and out of your house. Since we're doing it all cash-based, it'll be quick and easy.
AI: Alright. So that sounds good. At 2 o'clock tomorrow, around 2 o'clock, I'll let my partner know to give you a call.
Customer: Alright, yeah. You know, at any time, I'll for sure, this is just a one-time thing. Yeah, if everything works out. Yeah, you know, a thing you never know. 
AI: Yeah, I understand. Alright, it'll be from a different phone number, so if you see a different phone number call you, most likely the answer will be him.
Customer: Where are you guys out of?
AI: I'm in Novi, and my partner is also in Novi.
Customer: Alright, what are you guys running, real estate or?
AI: It's his company mainly. I'm just helping him along with it. Essentially, we buy properties and we do renovations to them and then we flip it. So if the property needs a lot of work and your, let's say if the property's valuation is like $80,000 but the person wants $100,000 for it, we're not going to be able to do it because we're trying to make lots of money on the same end of it. We're trying to benefit everyone.
Customer: That sounds incredible.
AI: Yeah. Alright, yeah, no problem. Thanks for your time and hope to have you answered tomorrow.
Customer: Alright, thanks. Bye-bye.
