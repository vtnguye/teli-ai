AI: Hello, are you the owner of 49 North Meramec Street in Pontiac?
Customer: Yeah. Yeah.
AI: So, I came across your property and was wondering if you were interested in selling it for cash.
Customer: Uh, how much cash do you have?
AI: Well, that's why I was going to ask you what's the number that you plan on selling it for? I mean, uh, what's your offer?
Customer: I can't give you a final number on it. I can give you a range, and obviously you can either get more for the property depending on how much renovations it has had. But the range that you are looking for is around $49,000 to $78,000. Once again, it could be higher or lower depending on the amount of renovations that the house has.
AI: I mean, if you say you've got cash, I'm willing to do $67,000.
Customer: Okay. I should, I'll be able to do it, but we're going to have to take a look at the property. I'm going to have to have one of my guys come out there and then pretty much deal, have deals and stuff and look at the property. If that's all good with you.
AI: When will that be? When do you want to send someone over?
Customer: Well, what time are you free? Tomorrow at 4? Does that work out for one of your guys?
AI: Okay, let me, tomorrow at 4. So could you tell me about the property, like how much renovations, like what needs to work and what doesn't?
Customer: Let me pass you to my assistant real quick.
AI: It's, um, I just want to make sure that I'm getting this right.
Customer: It's, um, I'm the one who really does like, he owns it, right? I've done a lot of, kind of do a lot of stuff, but the biggest thing is a lot of plumbing issues. It's not like the whole house. It's just within like the bathroom. We really haven't been able to kind of get that going. The bathroom doesn't work, one of the baths. And then there's a lot of holes if that makes sense. Drywall, a lot of like, you know, finish, the kind of finishing, finishing kind of stuff, finished carpentry. That's kind of the biggest thing I would say. And then, uh, and that's like the two, I think the two biggest things that's been like the biggest, you know, renovation.
AI: So you're saying plumbing issues and holes in the drywall?
Customer: Yeah, it's, um, like I said, he, if anyone is kind of skilled in drywall, I don't think it would be much of a problem. It's all pretty surface. Yeah. Plumbing, plumbing, I've had like three guys come and look at it and I don't know who the fuck rigged this shit up. But I'm going to let you know right now. It's complicated. I don't know if it's not getting the right stuff for the right things. I'm not a plumber by any means, but I mean, it's just, it's been a, it's just been fucking hell for me.
AI: Has there been any renovations actually done to the place?
Customer: Uh, yeah. I mean, we had flooring. We had some flooring in the kitchen. We had to reinstall the cabinets. The cabinet floor caps were just completely shit and, uh, and little shit, but nothing crazy. Nothing big. Like plumbing is like, is really just a method that we're missing.
AI: Okay. So if I'm, I'll be able to give you guys another call tomorrow. It'll be from one of my partners and she'll be able to set up a meet time and all that stuff where she would be able to come out and check the property.
Customer: I think that sounds good.
AI: Sounds good. All right, man. Hopefully by tomorrow I'll give you a call back and everything should be set. And what's your name?
Customer: Uh, Brandon.
AI: Nice to meet you, Brandon. I'm Johnny.
Customer: Nice to meet you as well, Johnny.
AI: So when you, if this deal does end up going through, obviously you guys are going to have saved on real estate costs as well as property costs. And, uh, yeah, and the hassle of people walking in and outside of your home.
Customer: Yeah, a hundred percent. We'll have that conversation too, you know, after you get a good look on it and all that stuff. Yeah. We make the decision, make an agreement if that, if it comes
