Hello, are you the owner of 49 North Meramec Street in Pontiac?
Yeah, why?
I came across your property and was wondering if you were interested in selling it for cash.
Uh, how much cash do you have?
I try to invest in about ten properties a month and was interested in this one so I wanted to give you a call.  
I mean, uh, what's your offer?
I can't give you an exact number on it since I have not walked the property, but I can give you a range around $49,000 to $78,000. It obviously can be maybe higher or lower than that range depending on how updated it is or if it needs any renovations. 
I mean, if you say you've got cash, I'm willing to do $67,000.
Okay. Thats definitley a number I can work with, i would just have to pass it along to my partner so he can do a final comp on the property. We would also have to come and walk the property ourselves so we can see the condition of the house in person of course.
I understand
If you don't mind me asking, does the property need any work done to it? or is it full up to date?
It has very bad plumbing issues, and the roof needs to be updated. Other than that, everything is pretty up to date. 
Okay, so how much money do you think needs to be put into the house? 
probably around fifteen to twenty thousand.
Okay. And is there a tenant in the property currenlty?
No
okay, well I am very interested and would love to come out and check the property whenever you are free.
Can you do tomorrow? 
I would have to check with my partner and get back to you of course 
No problem, just let me know
Sounds good, have a great rest of your day
