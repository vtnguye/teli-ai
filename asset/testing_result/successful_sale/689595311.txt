Hello 
Hi, are you the property owner on East Harry Avenue? 
I am. I am.
Awesome, I drove past your property about a week ago and I was wondering if you were interested in selling it for cash?
Make me an offer
Well, I cant give you an exact number until I have seen the property for myself, but I can give you a range from 100,000 to 150,000. 
Okay
It can obviously be more or less depending on the condition of the property. Can you tell me a little bit more about it and what you have done to it? 
It's a five bedroom, two baths. The kitchen and the main bathroom both need remodeling. I have a three car garage, full basement and two lots. I just put a new flooring in there. I have carpet that's a few years old that's about it. 
Okay, and the kitchen? 
Needs updating badly. 
How bad?
The whole kitchen needs to be redone.
Not a problem, I love finding properties that need work. And how about The bathrooms? 
They need work.   
And the bedrooms are fine? 
Yeah. Im pretty busy with work and stuff but we can figure out a time.
For sure. Is it okay if I give you ac all this week and we can maybe schedule something?
Yes sounds good, 
By the way, we do an all cash offer too. So I would save you real estate fees and closing costs. 
Okay. well, to be honest I plan on putting it on the market this week, probably by the end of the week. I'm going to be there on Wednesday if you want to walk through it. 
I'd love to walk it, but if you do not mind me asking...why post it on the market?
I feel like I can get rid of it quicker 
Yeah but then you have to pay all of those fees that I would take care of
Yeah, you are right
look, just take a few days and think about it and if you want to get paid cash and have this property off your hands just let me know. I can give you a call in a couple of days and we can work something out
okay, are you a wholesaler?
No Im just a private investor. I try to invest in about eight to ten homes a month. 
Wow, thats great. My nephew is trying to get into that right now
Its a great career thats for sure. 
Yeah
well, I will give you a call in a couple days. Nice speaking with you. 
sounds great, you as well man
