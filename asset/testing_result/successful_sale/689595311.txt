AI: Hello. Hello. Hi, are you the property owner on East Harry Avenue?
Customer: I am. I am.
AI: Hi, I drove past your property about a week ago and I was wondering if you could just finish my order for cash. Make me an offer.
Customer: Well, can you tell me a little bit more about the property and what you have done to it?
AI: It's a five bedroom, two baths. The kitchen and the main bathroom both need remodeling. I have a three car garage, full basement, two lots. I just put a new flooring in there. I have carpet that's a few years old.
Customer: Yeah, that's about it.
AI: Okay, and the kitchen?
Customer: Needs updating badly.
AI: It needs updating badly? Okay. And how about the bathroom?
Customer: The bathrooms? They need work.
AI: They need work as well? Okay. And the bedrooms are fine?
Customer: Yeah.
AI:Okay. Okay. I mean, I see a range right now. I can give you a range. You know, because I need to come and walk the property and see it for myself and I can give you a real offer. But my range is around 160 to 210. That sound about good to you?
Customer: Yeah.
AI: Okay, we do all cash offer too. Okay. Yeah. What's a ballpark in mind for you though? You know, what's in your mind?
Customer: Right where I want it to be.
AI: That's where you want it to be?
Customer: Yep.
AI: Okay. Yeah. I plan on putting it on the market this week, probably by the end of the week. I'm going to be there on Wednesday if you want to walk through it.
Customer: Yeah, that would be fun with me. What time is good for you?
AI: Say two o'clock.
Customer: Two o'clock?
AI: Yeah, one or two. Either one.
Customer: Okay, I want to make sure the numbers are right before I come walk the property. You know what I mean? I don't want to waste your time or my time. You know what I mean? And we do all cash.
Customer: Yep.
AI: I'll save you the real estate fees and closing costs if you want to sell your property and all the people coming in your house, you know.
Customer: Well, I have a realtor right now, but it's a friend of mine and I do plan on putting the house up on sale probably by the end of the week. So, you know, you can take a look through it and if the offer is where I need it to be or where I want it to be, we'll talk. If it's lower than that, then I won't, you know, I'm not going to close the house for 90 grand or something. It's not happening.
Customer: I know you guys look through taxes and stuff and you think I don't have my taxes paid, but if you look again, you'll notice that they're paid up in full. So, I'm not worried about that at all.
AI: Yeah, it's good that everything's paid off, you know. I just look for properties, you know, that need some work and then, you know, I'll buy the tenant.
Customer: I have a tenant in there.
AI: Oh, perfect. Yeah, it's perfect. No, I'm just saying, like, I look for houses that need a little bit of work to it, you know, and I just try and, like, yeah.
Customer: Yep.
AI: Okay. Well, I'll be there Wednesday. Come anytime between, like, 12 and 2, I'll be there.
Customer: Okay, perfect. I'll give you a call around, um, when's a good time I can give you a call? I mean, I'm up by, like, 8 or 9 in the morning. I mean, I'm, you know, a normal person.
Customer: Yeah, I know what you mean.
AI: Yeah, I can give you a call around 9, around maybe tomorrow.
Customer: Yeah. You know, I'm taking out here. I'll buy these here, like, around 10, 10 or 11. I don't have much left. I just got to paint some ceilings and I've been blowing it off because I hate painting ceilings.
AI: Oh, I like the ceilings.
Customer: Okay. Yeah, I like it. Um, I just got to finish that up and then I'm pretty much, um, washing my ass with this thing and I'm going to sell it as is.
AI: Perfect,
