Hello? 
Hi, is this the property owner on Emerson Ave.
Yeah why?
I was just calling to see if you might be interested in hearing a cash offer on the property. I'm a local real estate investor in the area and was very interested in this property.
Yeah I am interested. I also own about thirty other properties.
Okay, yeah, you own about 30 others. Thats great.
Yeah, I have a lot of people interested in buying them.
Oh, okay, so you don't want to sell it?
No, I want to sell it.
Everybody talks and nobody makes an offer.
Okay, I'll throw you an offer right now. Would you take $50,000 cash?
Well, I'm at another rental right now. I might go home and check it. But it looks like maybe yes.
Okay, let me get you down as a call back. When can I check back with you?
Well, I'm waiting for the city of Pontiac water department to come over here. And maybe between noon and three o'clock.
Okay. Can I just call you tomorrow?
Um, well, Thursday's all right.
Okay. Thursday's all right.
Yeah. How did you come upon Emerson?
Honestly, I just passed by it and was very interested in it and many other houses in your neighborhood. Just wanted to see if anyone's ever interested in selling and, you know, giving everyone a call. 
Okay, how did you get my number yet?
I went through the public records from the city and your number was connected to the property so i thought I'd give you a call. 
Okay. Because I just, I just got it about two weeks ago.
Oh, wow
Would you be interested in buying more properties?
Yeah.
Or just Emerson?
Any property you have, I'm interested in looking at. Of course, the pricing has to make sense. but I'm interested in buying anything.
You are?
yes
Well, okay. I guess I'll have to go home and find out what's going on. Because I'm 80 years old and time for me to get out of the business now.
How many properties do you own?
11 of them.
Okay. Because I'll buy all of them if we can agree on a price of course. 
That's not a problem.
Okay.
Well, what I've been trying to get is whatever the government can, I've been trying to get is whatever the government taxes me at, the value they tax me at, which is always lower than the market value. If I get that, you can have all eleven properties. 
Okay. Could you tell me what that price is and then we can just, you know, go from there?
Well, again, I don't have a price right now. I would have to think about it.
Yeah, I know, of course. But I'm saying if I give you a call back. Would you at least have an idea of a number for all of the properties?
Okay.
I can, I can come up with it.
Okay, perfect then. I'll reach out to you tomorrow and we'll talk from there. And my name is George by the way.
Jordan?
George.
Oh, George. Okay.
yes
Okay. I will get all the information for you and we will talk soon.
Okay.
Well, thank you for calling.
No problem.
Bye.
