Hello? 
Hi, yes, this is a property owner on Emerson Ave.
Yeah?
Uh, I was just calling to see if you might be interested in hearing a cash offer on the property.
I'm a local real estate investor and I own the company.
Okay, yeah, you own about 30 others.
30 other what?
People want to buy that property.
Oh, okay, so you don't want to sell it?
No, I want to sell it.
Everybody talks and nobody makes an offer.
Okay, I'll throw you an offer right now.
Well, do you want, would you take $50,000 cash?
Well, I'm at another rental right now.
I might go home and check it.
But it looks like maybe yes.
Okay, let me get you down as a call back.
When can I check back with you?
Well, I'm waiting for the city of Pontiac water department to come over here.
And maybe between noon and three o'clock.
Okay.
I won't, then I gotta go over to Wyoming Live and I probably won't get, probably about nine o'clock tonight.
Can I just call you tomorrow?
Um, well, Thursday's all right.
Yeah.
Okay. Thursday's, Thursday's all right.
Yeah.
How did you come upon Emerson?
Honestly, I just passed it.
You and a bunch of your neighbors.
Just wanted to see if anyone's ever interested in selling and, you know, giving you guys a call.
Okay, how did you get my number yet?
I requested it.
I found it online.
Found it online?
Okay.
Because I just, I just got it about two weeks ago.
Oh, I really found it online.
Okay.
Would you be interested in buying more properties?
Yeah.
Or just Emerson?
Any property you have, I'm interested in looking at it.
Of course, the pricing's gonna make sense, but I'm interested in buying anything.
You are?
Okay.
Yeah.
Well, okay.
I guess I'll have to go home and find out what's going on.
Because I'm 80 years old and time for me to get out of business now.
How many properties do you own?
11 of them.
Okay.
Because I'm just, I'll buy all of them, you know?
That's not a problem.
Okay.
Well, what I've been trying to get is whatever the government can, I've been trying to get is whatever the government taxes me at, the value they tax me at, which is always lower than the market value.
If I get that, you can have a whole $11.
Okay.
Could you tell me what that price is and then we can just, you know, evenly split it up?
Well, again, I don't have it with me right now.
Yeah, I know, of course.
But I'm saying if I give you a call back.
Okay.
I can, I can come up with it.
Okay, perfect then.
I'll reach out to you tomorrow and we'll talk from there.
And my name is George, by the way.
Jordan?
George.
Oh, George.
Okay.
Okay. George.
Okay.
Okay.
And I will get the other ones for you.
Okay.
Well, thank you for calling.
No problem.
Bye.
