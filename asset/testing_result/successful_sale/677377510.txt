Customer: Hello? Hello? 
AI: Hi, yes, this is a property owner on Emerson Ave. 
Customer: Yeah? 
AI: Uh, I was just calling to see if you might be interested in hearing a cash offer on the property. I'm a local real estate investor and I own the company. 
Customer: Okay, yeah, you own about 30 others. 
AI: 30 other what? 
Customer: People want to buy that property. 
AI: Oh, okay, so you don't want to sell it? 
Customer: No, I want to sell it. But everybody talks and nobody makes an offer. 
AI: Okay, I'll throw you an offer right now. 
Customer: Well, do you want, would you take $50,000 cash? 
AI: ... 
Customer: Well, I'm at another rental right now. I might go home and check it. But it looks like maybe yes.
AI: Okay, let me get you down as a call back. When can I check back with you? 
Customer: Well, I'm waiting for the city of Pontiac water department to come over here. And maybe between noon and three o'clock. 
AI: Okay. I won't, then I gotta go over to Wyoming Live and I probably won't get, probably about nine o'clock tonight. Can I just call you tomorrow? 
Customer: Um, well, Thursday's all right. Yeah. 
AI: Okay. Thursday's, Thursday's all right. Yeah. 
Customer: How did you come upon Emerson? 
AI: Honestly, I drove past it, you and a bunch of your neighbors. Just wanted to see if anyone's ever interested in selling and, you know, giving you guys a call. 
Customer: Okay, how did you get my number yet? 
AI: I requested it. I found it online. 
Customer: Found it online? 
AI: Okay. I just got it about two weeks ago. 
Customer: Oh, I really found it online. Okay. Would you be interested in buying more properties? 
AI: Yeah. Or just Emerson? Any property you have, I'm interested in looking at it. Of course, the pricing's gonna make sense, but I'm interested in buying anything. 
Customer: You are? Okay. Yeah. 
AI: Well, okay. I guess I'll have to go home and find out what's going on, because I'm 80 years old and time for me to get out of business now. 
Customer: How many properties do you own? 
AI: 11 of them. Okay. Because I'll buy all of them, you know? That's not a problem. Okay. Well, what I've been trying to get is whatever the government can // Well, I've been trying to get is whatever the government taxes me at, the value they tax me at, which is always lower than the market value. If I get that, you can have a whole $11. 
Customer: Okay. 
AI: Could you tell me what that price is and then we can just, you know, evenly split it up? 
Customer: Well, again, I don't have it with me right now. Yeah, I know. Of course. But I'm saying if I give you a call back. 
AI: Okay, I can come up with it. Okay, perfect. Then I'll reach out to you tomorrow and we'll talk from there. And my name is George, by the way. 
Customer: Jordan? George. 
AI: Oh, George. Okay. Okay. George. Okay. Okay. 
Customer: And I will get the other ones for you. Okay. 
AI: Well, thank you for calling. 
Customer: No problem. Bye.
