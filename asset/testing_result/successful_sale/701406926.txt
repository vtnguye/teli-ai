Customer: Hello, are you the homeowner of 1401 Elgin Street, No Park?
AI: Yes, I am. By any chance, are you interested in selling the property for cash?
Customer: No, thank you. I do have another property in Southfield. Are you interested in that one?
AI: Yes. Okay. Well, I don't have the list pulled up for that. Are you a realtor or are you a buyer?
Customer: I'm a buyer.
AI: Well, I'm not – we're looking for homes that need renovations. We fix them up, and then we resell them for profit.
Customer: Oh, I see. Okay. Can you text me your information? I do have one that I would like you to look at. If you want, I can also – I'll save your number, and then within the next day or so I can have one of my partners call you, and then you guys work it out even more if that sounds well.
Customer: Okay, that's perfect.
AI: All right, thank you for your time. You have a good one. Bye-bye.
