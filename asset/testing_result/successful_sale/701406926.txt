Hello, are you the homeowner of 140 Jersey 1 Elgin Street, No Park?
Yes, I am.
By any chance, are you interested in selling the property for cash?
No, thank you. I do have another property in Southfield.
Are you interested in that one?
Yes.
Okay. Well, I don't have the list pulled up for that.
Are you a realtor or are you a buyer?
I'm a buyer. Well, we're looking for homes that need renovations.
We fixed them up and then we resell them for profit.
Oh, I see. Okay. Can you text me your information?
I do have one that I would like you to look at.
If you want, I can also save your number and then within the next day or so,
I can have one of my partners call you and then you guys work it out even more.
That sounds well.
Okay, that's perfect.
All right, thank you for your time. You have a good one.
Bye-bye. Bye.
