We can make all-cash offers.\nCustomer: Well, can you tell me a little bit more about the property and what you have in mind?\nYou: It's a five-bedroom, two-bath property with a three-car garage, full basement, and two lots. The kitchen and the main bathroom both need remodeling. I just put a new flooring in there. I have carpet that's a few years old. Would you be willing to sell it in the range of 160 to 210?\nCustomer: Yeah, that sounds about right.\nYou: That's great. What's the ballpark in mind for you?\nCustomer: Right where I want it to be.\nYou: Okay. We plan on putting it on the market this week, probably by the end of the week.

Why?\nYou: Well, I came across your property and was wondering if you were interested in selling it for cash.\nCustomer: Oh, shit. All depends, man. The right price is always the right price.\nYou: What's the price that you have in mind for the property?\nCustomer: I was thinking probably like at least around 130, 140.\nYou: Okay, 130, 140. And could you tell me any renovations that have been done to the property?\nCustomer: Well, they've done to the property. I just basically put new flooring in and just regular maintaining work, you know what I'm saying?\nYou: Alright. And was there any problems with the house when it comes to piping, stuff like that, heating?\nCustomer: No, no, everything worked.\nYou: Great. So the range I can give you on the house is going to be between $119,000 and $163,000. That's the range. And obviously it could either be lower or higher depending on your renovations and how much work the house actually needs. So with your estimate and your value you want, you are at least in the ballpark of where we want it to be. I can give your number to one of my partners and have them call you tomorrow if you're free. What time works best for you?\nCustomer: Around the same time.\nYou: Alright, around 2 o'clock tomorrow I'll let my partner know to give you a call. And if you were to go with this deal, you're going to be saving on real estate fees as well as property fees, as well as all the hassle when it comes to putting the house on the market when you have people going in and out of your house. Since we're doing it all cash based it'll be quick and easy. \nCustomer: Alright. \nYou: Great. So we'll have my partner call you tomorrow at 2 o'clock. It's not a for sure thing, but if everything works out, we can move forward. You never know. It'll be from a different phone number. If you see a different phone number call you, most likely it'll be him. And just to let you know, we're based in Novi. Essentially we buy properties, do renovations to them, and then flip them. So if the property needs a lot of work and the property valuation is like $80,000 but the person wants $100,000 for it, we're not going to be able to do it because we're trying to make money on the same end of it. We're trying to benefit everyone. \nCustomer: Alright. \nYou: Thanks for your time, and hope to have your answer tomorrow. \nCustomer: Alright. Thanks. \nYou: You're welcome.
